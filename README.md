  **Description of the Task: File Operations in Java**

The given task requires creating a Java program that demonstrates file handling operations – specifically reading, writing, and modifying text files. File handling is a fundamental concept in programming, enabling persistent data storage, retrieval, and updates, which are essential for applications ranging from simple log generators to complex database systems.

Firstly, reading a text file involves accessing an existing file on the system and retrieving its contents. In Java, this is typically performed using classes like FileReader, BufferedReader, or Scanner. Reading files line by line allows processing large files efficiently without loading the entire file into memory at once.

Secondly, writing to a file involves creating a new file or overwriting an existing file with data. This is implemented using classes such as FileWriter, BufferedWriter, or PrintWriter. Writing is crucial for generating reports, saving user inputs, logging system information, or exporting processed data. The program should demonstrate creating a new file if it does not exist and writing specified data into it.

The third aspect is modifying a text file. Since Java does not support direct in-place modification of text files due to file system constraints, the standard approach involves reading the original file’s content, applying the desired modifications in the program (e.g., replacing words, appending new lines, or deleting lines), and writing the modified content back either to the same file or to a new file. This ensures data integrity and allows efficient text transformations. For example, in a student records system, this operation can update marks, attendance records, or any field in a text-based data file.

The deliverable for this task is a Java script that clearly demonstrates all three operations with thorough documentation. Documentation is crucial because it explains the purpose of each code block, the flow of execution, exception handling, and file closing procedures, enhancing maintainability and readability. It should cover:

Importing necessary I/O classes (java.io.*).

Exception handling using try-catch-finally or try-with-resources to manage resources effectively.

Creating files and writing content using FileWriter and BufferedWriter.

Reading files using FileReader and BufferedReader.

Modifying files by reading existing data, applying changes in Java collections (like ArrayList), and writing back updated data.

Additionally, the script should demonstrate best practices such as closing file streams after operations to prevent resource leaks, checking if a file exists before reading or writing, and handling exceptions like FileNotFoundException and IOException.

Understanding and implementing file operations solidifies programming fundamentals, as file I/O is used extensively in desktop applications, web servers for reading configurations, and even Android app development where local file storage is necessary. Completing this task will build your confidence in handling real-world projects requiring data persistence, backup, and text processing.

Finally, ensure your code follows clean coding standards, including meaningful comments, indentation, and naming conventions. This will not only help you in your academic submissions but also prepare you for practical software development where clarity, accuracy, and efficiency are valued.
